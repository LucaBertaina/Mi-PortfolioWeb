        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <P>
            I am a passionate programmer with a solid foundation in several technologies, including SQL, MongoDB, Java, Python, and web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I enjoy exploring how different tools and languages connect to create functional and creative solutions.
            I consider myself a sociable and curious person who loves to collaborate, share ideas, and learn from others. I’m always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and improve my skills, whether by taking on new challenges, experimenting with projects, or studying emerging technologies.
            For me, programming is more than just writing code — it’s about solving problems, learning something new every day, and creating things that can make a difference.
        </P>

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>My knowledge of HTML goes back to high school, where I first learned the basics and understood how everything is structured. Later, at UTN University, I was able to strengthen and deepen my skills with this tool, gaining a more complete understanding of web development and how to build well-structured, functional websites.</p>
